  ## Description
  When you are running a big team of employees, sometimes it can be hard to remember everybody and their postitions or contact information. This application was made to help users efficiently and easily make a team profile. The profile contains cards for each team member and includes important information such as their employee ID, contacts, and job position. Upon starting the application using node, the user will answer the prompts that follow, and the application will take that information and generate the team profile in the index.html file. The use of tests with jest was applied in this application along with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
